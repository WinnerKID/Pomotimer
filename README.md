# Study Timer
<p>This is a timer built for linux operating systems in mind.</p>
<p>It is built for the pomodoro learning technique so, there's 2 inputs you can put in that'll ring once timer is completed.</p>

User should have ```/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga``` already in their linux directory if not you can just replace the line of code with any sound you prefer.
