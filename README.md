<p>This is a timer built for linux operating systems in mind.</p>
<p>It is built for the pomodoro learning technique so, there's 3 inputs you can put in. The first input represents the first timer, the second input represents the second timer and, the third input is the number of repeats.</p>

User should have ```/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga``` already in their linux directory if not you can just replace the line of code with any sound you prefer.
